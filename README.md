# simulation

A minimal framework for simulating agents interacting over time within a shared environment.

This repository provides simple abstractions for:
- Agents with state and behavior
- Environments with shared state and time
- Simulations that orchestrate interaction

The goal is to support experimentation with agent-based systems while keeping the core model explicit, testable, and extensible.

This project intentionally avoids coupling to specific AI models or APIs. Future extensions may include language-model-driven agents, but the foundation remains model-agnostic.
